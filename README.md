# 🏗️ Building in Public: My AWS-Powered Pet Project Journey

**Building in Public** is pretty self-explanatory:
**Building. In. Public.**
Need I say more?

This repo documents the live development of my *Pet Project* website — powered mostly by **AWS services**, with a strong emphasis on **cost optimization**, transparency, and growth through sharing.

## 💡 Why Build in Public?

### 🚀 Real-Time Feedback

Sharing my progress as I build invites suggestions, alternatives, and insights that help me improve and make smarter decisions — faster.

### 🌍 Community & Connection

By building publicly, I get to engage with like-minded creators and seasoned professionals. I learn from their mistakes, their wins, and their processes.

### 🗣️ Improved Communication

Documenting every step forces me to articulate my thoughts clearly — which sharpens my understanding and helps others learn too.

### 📚 Active Learning & Retention

By turning my build process into words, I teach myself and others. It’s a level above passive learning — it’s learning by doing, sharing, and reflecting.

### ✅ Accountability

Once you make your work public, there’s no going ghost! It adds a layer of personal responsibility that helps keep the momentum going.

## ☁️ Tech Stack (Mostly AWS)

* Hosting: AWS (e.g. S3, EC2, or Amplify)
* Backend (TBD): AWS Lambda + API Gateway
* DNS: **NOT** Route53… yet. I opted for a local .co.za provider at ZAR 90 (\~USD \$5), which is significantly cheaper than Route53’s USD \$13.

  > *Note to future self: keep checking if Route53 pricing improves!*

## ✍️ Lessons So Far

* Building cloud-native doesn’t mean blindly committing to every cloud-native tool — cost and local context matter.
* There’s tremendous value in “showing your work.”
* Even small updates can build massive momentum over time.

## 📌 Conclusion

By building in public, I’m not just building a project — I’m building:

* A **feedback loop**
* A **community**
* **Accountability**
* Better **communication**
* **Knowledge that sticks**

> You don’t just learn — you learn, unlearn, and relearn… *live.*
